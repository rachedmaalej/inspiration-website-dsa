Pierced brass lanterns hang from the ceiling, casting intricate geometric shadow patterns on the cream-colored walls. A doorway framed by a horseshoe arch leads to a warmly lit sauna room beyond. Natural materials everywhere: polished marble floor, rough stone walls, dark wood accents, copper fittings. Small blue-and-white zellige tile accents around the doorway. Steam softly rising, creating a dreamy atmosphere. Style: spa interior photography, Six Senses aesthetic, serene and luxurious.

---

Pale pink-gold light on the horizon behind the trees. The ground between the rows is tilled red-brown earth with a thin layer of morning dew. Extremely serene and quiet atmosphere. Muted, desaturated color palette: soft peach sky, grey-green foliage, dusty earth tones. No people, no buildings — pure nature and geometry.

---

### P2-PILLAR-1 — Bedroom Detail (3:4 portrait)

> Close-up still life detail in a luxury guesthouse bedroom. A stack of crisp white linen napkins tied with a sprig of fresh rosemary rests on a rough-hewn olive wood bedside table. Behind it, a small terracotta pot holds a single orange blossom branch with waxy white flowers and glossy dark green leaves. The whitewashed wall behind is textured lime plaster. Soft diffused natural morning light from the left. Extremely minimal composition with generous negative space. Color palette: white, cream, warm wood, deep green leaf, white blossom.

A thin stream of water pools on the marble surface reflecting warm light. Minimalist composition with generous breathing room.

On the plate: a carefully composed Tunisian salad mechouia — chunks of grilled red and green peppers, drizzled with green olive oil, topped with a single olive and a wedge of hard-boiled egg. A torn piece of round tabouna bread beside the plate. A clear glass of golden olive oil nearby. Harsh but beautiful directional side-light creating strong shadows. Minimal, clean, editorial. Color palette: warm wood, blue ceramic, red and green peppers, golden olive oil. Style: Cereal Magazine food photography, Mediterranean minimalism.

---

### P2-PILLAR-4 — Retreat Activity (3:4 portrait)

> A lone figure in white loose-fitting clothing practicing yoga (tree pose) outdoors among the orange trees of a Tunisian orchard. Shot from behind, silhouetted against soft morning backlight filtering through the citrus canopy. Dappled light and shadow on the tilled earth ground.

## PROPOSAL 3: Terre d'Agrumes (Warm Mediterranean / Artisanal)

### P3-COLLAGE-1 — Architecture / Courtyard (3:4 portrait, 180x220px display)

> A courtyard view inside a traditional Tunisian dar. Looking up through a horseshoe arch at a small orange tree growing in the center of a tiled courtyard. The arch frame is whitewashed with traces of carved stucco decoration. Zellige tilework in blue, green, and terracotta covers the lower walls. Magenta bougainvillea spills over a second-floor wrought-iron balustrade above. The sky is a deep Mediterranean blue visible through the open courtyard. Warm golden afternoon light illuminates the far wall while the arch creates a cool shadow in the foreground. Terracotta pots with geraniums at the base of the orange tree.

---

### P3-COLLAGE-2 — Gardens / Grounds (3:4 portrait, 140x170px display)

On either side: lavender, rosemary bushes, and wild herbs growing along the path edges. In the middle distance, a weathered stone bench under an olive tree. Beyond, a glimpse of whitewashed walls and a blue door. Warm dappled sunlight filtering through the citrus canopy creates pools of light on the gravel. Small wildflowers (yellow and white) dot the path edges. Style: garden photography, English countryside meets North African warmth, inviting and tactile.

---

### P3-COLLAGE-3 — Produce Detail (3:4 portrait, 120x140px display)

The simplicity and rawness of the converted agricultural building is the feature — rough stone meets clean modern wellness. Warm, diffused light. Style: wellness studio editorial, raw and refined, converted architecture.

---

### P3-CARD-3 — Deguster Card Header (4:3 landscape)

> An outdoor dining table set for lunch under a vine-covered pergola on a Tunisian estate. A rustic wooden table with hand-painted Nabeul ceramic plates, olive wood serving boards, and a tagine pot with its conical lid. Bread in an esparto grass basket. Small bowls of harissa and olive oil. Clear glasses for mint tea. Orange trees visible beyond the pergola. Dappled sunlight through the vine leaves creating beautiful shadow patterns on the table.

---

### P3-CARD-4 — S'evader Card Header (4:3 landscape)

Shot from behind, warm golden late-afternoon backlight. The orchard rows create leading lines into the frame. The people are dressed casually in earth tones and white linen. One person reaches up to touch an orange on a low branch. A sense of discovery and gentle adventure. Style: lifestyle editorial, retreat experience photography, warm and aspirational.

---

## PROPOSAL 4: Edito (Bold Contemporary / Editorial)

### P4-HERO — Editorial Property Shot (1:1 or 4:5 portrait, right half of split hero)

> High-contrast editorial photograph of a single horseshoe archway in a Tunisian guesthouse courtyard. Strong directional sunlight creates a dramatic shaft of light through the arch onto a zellige-tiled floor, with the rest of the image in deep shadow. Through the arch, an orange tree and a fragment of blue sky are visible. Geometric shadow pattern from an unseen mashrabiya screen falls across the floor. Bold, dramatic, high contrast. The image should feel like a magazine cover — confident, architectural, intentional. Color palette: deep shadows, one shaft of warm golden light, blue sky fragment, zellige pattern. Style: high-contrast architectural editorial, Monocle magazine, black-and-warm-gold.

---

### P4-SPREAD-1 — Sejourner Editorial (16:9 landscape, magazine spread)

Steam rises softly, diffusing the light into a celestial glow. In the foreground, folded white towels and a hammered copper water bowl. The far wall features an arched alcove with small blue-and-gold zellige tiles. Water droplets on the marble surface catch the light. No people — the empty space invites the viewer in.

---

### P4-SPREAD-3 — Deguster Editorial (16:9 landscape, magazine spread)

Hand-painted Nabeul ceramics in blue and terracotta. Hands reaching into the frame from two sides (a communal, social moment). Strong directional light from one side creates dramatic shadows.

---

### P4-SPREAD-4 — S'evader Editorial (16:9 landscape, magazine spread)

On the horizon, the jagged silhouette of Jbel Ressas mountain against a sky blazing with layers of amber, coral, and deep purple. A single figure walks along a path between the orchards, small in the vast landscape, heading toward the mountain. Long shadows stretch across the golden earth. Style: dramatic landscape editorial, National Geographic meets Cereal Magazine, cinematic golden hour.

---

## PROPOSAL 5: Les Saisons (Immersive Storytelling)

### P5-VIDEO — Aerial Drone Shot (21:9 ultra-wide cinematic)

> Ultra-wide cinematic aerial photograph of the Domaine Sidi Abdallah property from a drone at 50-meter altitude. The geometric rows of the orange orchard dominate the frame, creating a mesmerizing pattern of dark green circles (tree canopies) on red-brown earth in a perfect grid. The whitewashed main house sits at the center-left with its courtyard, terracotta roofs, and turquoise pool visible. A gravel driveway curves toward the entrance. To the right, the reconverted wellness center building (Agrumia) with its stone walls. Gardens and pathways connect the buildings. Beyond the property boundary, more orchards and agricultural land stretch toward the dramatic rocky silhouette of Jbel Ressas on the horizon.

---

### P5-CHAPTER-1 — Morning / Sejourner (16:9, full-width background)

> A soft, dreamy morning scene at a Tunisian guesthouse. View from inside a bedroom looking out through open blue-shuttered French doors onto a private terrace. On the terrace: a small round wrought-iron table set for breakfast — a ceramic bowl of yogurt with pomegranate seeds, a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice, a plate of msemmen (Tunisian flatbread), and a small pot of local honey. Beyond the terrace railing, the orange orchard stretches into gentle morning mist, backlit by the rising sun. Everything is suffused with soft peachy-gold early morning light. The mood is of waking gently to paradise. Color temperature: warm peach and gold, soft greens. Style: lifestyle editorial, luxury morning scene, intimate and aspirational, Villa Lena aesthetic.

---

### P5-CHAPTER-2 — Midday / Se Detendre (16:9, full-width background)

> A serene scene at the Agrumia wellness center during midday. A turquoise swimming pool surrounded by mature orange trees, shot from a low lounge-chair perspective. The pool surface is perfectly calm, reflecting the sky and the trees in its surface. A white linen towel is draped over one wooden sun lounger. Beyond the pool, the stone facade of the converted wellness center building with its arched entrance. The light is bright and clear — midday Mediterranean sun creating strong blue shadows under the trees and on the white building walls. The sky is a deep, saturated cobalt blue. A single bougainvillea plant in full magenta bloom near the pool edge. Absolute stillness and calm. Style: pool and wellness editorial, bright and refreshing, cool blues and warm stone.

---

### P5-CHAPTER-3 — Afternoon / Deguster (16:9, full-width background)

> A warm, inviting outdoor dining scene under the orange trees of a Tunisian estate in late afternoon. A long rustic wooden table is set for a farm-to-table dinner. Terracotta candle holders with lit candles (despite it being late afternoon, adding warmth). Hand-painted ceramic plates, linen napkins, and a centerpiece of fresh oranges, lemons, and herbs on an olive wood board. Overhead, string lights are strung between the orange tree branches (not yet lit, waiting for dusk). The golden afternoon light filters through the citrus canopy creating warm dappled patterns across the table and the diners' empty chairs. The setting is generous, abundant, and romantically rustic. In the background, the stone facade of the estate restaurant. Style: outdoor dining editorial, golden hour warmth, Babylonstoren meets Ottolenghi, warm amber-and-green palette.

---

### P5-CHAPTER-4 — Evening / S'evader (16:9, full-width background, dark/moody)

> A moody twilight scene at the Tunisian domaine. View across the orange orchard at dusk — the trees are dark silhouettes against a deep indigo-and-purple sky. Small warm lantern lights (traditional Tunisian pierced brass lanterns) glow along a garden path between the trees, creating golden pools of light in the blue darkness. In the far background, a faint warm glow emanates from the windows of the guesthouse. The silhouette of Jbel Ressas mountain is barely visible as a dark shape against the last traces of amber on the western horizon. Stars are beginning to appear in the darkest part of the sky overhead. Fireflies or small string lights add tiny sparks of warmth. The mood is magical, intimate, and otherworldly — the transition from day to night at a place where time stands still. Style: twilight landscape photography, moody and atmospheric, deep blues and warm amber accents, enchanting.

---

## SHARED / MULTI-PURPOSE IMAGES

### SHARED-1 — Orange Blossom Close-Up (1:1 square, for icons/decorative use)

> Macro close-up photograph of a single cluster of orange blossoms (neroli) on a branch. The white waxy petals are tinged with cream, centered with golden stamens. Glossy dark green leaves frame the blossoms. A tiny bee approaches one flower. The background is a smooth bokeh of green orchard blur. Soft diffused natural light. Extremely detailed — every petal vein, every dewdrop visible. The image evokes scent — you can almost smell the orange blossom fragrance. Style: botanical macro photography, fine art, shallow depth of field.

---

### SHARED-2 — Zellige Tile Pattern (1:1 square, for textures/backgrounds)

> Overhead photograph of authentic Tunisian zellige tilework floor detail. Hand-cut geometric star-and-cross pattern in cobalt blue, turquoise, cream white, and terracotta orange on a warm cream background. The tiles are slightly irregular — showing the handmade character with tiny variations in color and alignment. Grout lines are thin and sand-colored. Natural side-lighting reveals the subtle three-dimensional texture of each hand-cut tile. No perspective distortion — shot perfectly flat from above. Style: material texture photography, artisanal detail, suitable as a repeating pattern element.

---

### SHARED-3 — Hammered Copper Detail (1:1 square, for icons/decorative use)

> Close-up detail photograph of a traditional hammered copper hammam bowl (tassa) filled with water and floating orange slices. The interior of the bowl gleams with warm amber reflections.

The background is dark and out of focus — polished marble with steam. Style: still life detail photography, spa product aesthetic, warm metallic tones, intimate and tactile.
